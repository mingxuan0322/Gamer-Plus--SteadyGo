## Rehabilitation Meets Accessible Gaming: A Case-Based Co-Design with a Young Gamer

SteadyGo is an adaptive gaming interface that transforms seated posture and body balance into in-game control, co-designed to support accessible play and rehabilitation.

This custom-built assistive gaming and rehabilitation device is designed for Siyi Li, a 22-year-old with cerebral palsy caused by birth asphyxia. Despite limited mobility, she persistently trains at home and attends outpatient rehab sessions. Siyi enjoys writing stories, reciting poetry, creating videos, and playing games like Genshin Impact.
This project began in response to her wish to "fly freely with Paimon"—combining her aspirations for independence and play with therapeutic needs in daily life.

### Abstract
This project explores alternative control in creating accessible gaming experience. Through an adaptive interface that converts seated posture and balance into in-game movement, the project incorporeats bodily weight into creating movements in game. Developed with a disabled co-designer, the setup includes a custom pressure-sensitive cushion, modified joysticks and tactile button layout—allowing users to navigate virtual space through physical engagement, not hand-held precision.

Rooted in accessibility design and rehabilitation practice, this interface is designed to enhance physical therapy via immersive game. New users may find movement unintuitive at first—often due to posture or weight distribution—offering insight into how design can accommodate diverse bodies without resorting to standard control logic.

This project is part of a modular, personalized system tailored to the co-designer’s needs, demonstrating how interaction can be reimagined through care, adaptability, and embodied intelligence.
